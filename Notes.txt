the project is about the construction paramater to be considered when built a house . in this project we focuses on to determine the heating and cooling load of the building which can be affect by other external parameters such as relative compactness, roof area , orientation, wall area , glazing area and more 

the main abjective of this projevt is to find the reason or parameters to optimise the heating load and cooling load which enables the good living and strength. so we want to analyse the key factors which are contibuting target variable (heat and cool load). 

before go into analysis , we want to undestand the data and its features. because each of it represents certain values that are contributing the target.

realtive_comapctness- the higher compactness will affect the thermal and energy effiency

surface area - wall_area+ (roof_area *2)+ glazing_area

wall area - this covers the external  side area of the house

roof area- top area of the house

glazing area - this covers the transparent area such as windows

overall height - height of the building 

orientation - In which side, the house facing such as south , north , west , east
