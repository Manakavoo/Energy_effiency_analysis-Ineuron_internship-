# Energy Efficiency Analysis - Ineuron Internship

This project is part of my internship at Ineuron, where I analyze the energy efficiency of residential buildings using machine learning.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to investigate the factors affecting the heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) of residential buildings. We aim to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the HL and CL based on various building parameters.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about eight input variables that may influence HL and CL. These variables include:

- Relative Compactness
- Surface Area
- Wall Area
- Roof Area
- Overall Height
- Orientation
- Glazing Area
- Glazing Area Distribution

## Methodology

We will compare two approaches for building the predictive model:

1. **Linear Regression**: A traditional approach that assumes a linear relationship between input variables and HL/CL.
2. **Random Forests**: A sophisticated non-linear, non-parametric method that can capture complex relationships in the data.

## Results

We will evaluate the performance of both models based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared value. The model with the lowest error and highest R-squared value will be considered the most effective for predicting HL and CL.

## Future Work

In the future, we may explore other machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, to further improve the accuracy of our predictions. Additionally, we could consider incorporating more features or external data sources to enhance the model's performance.
